# Bard Builds

  ## Chaos Dungeon/Cube Build
  
  ### Introduction
  
The Chaos and Cube build heavily focuses on large Area of Effect (AoE) skills with low Cooldowns to clear the content as fast as possible. This content isn't difficult and can easily be completed by spamming skills. The Cube requires some additional teamwork and stage knowledge to complete.

### Combat Stat Distribution

Sub-stat priority is not important, as the content is easy as long as the player is using matching Tier Gear and accessories. Swiftness and Specializatioon stats help with speed clearing, but is not necessary if you don't have separate sets of accessories.

- <img src="https://d3planner-assets.maxroll.gg/lost-ark/icons/bd_skill_01_7.png" width="20" height="20"> Prelude of Storm and <img src="https://d3planner-assets.maxroll.gg/lost-ark/icons/bd_skill_01_13.png" width="20" height="20"> Sonic Vibration work great at low levels, as they both CC mobs with stun.

- You can use <img src="https://d3planner-assets.maxroll.gg/lost-ark/icons/bd_skill_01_11.png" width="20" height="20"> Prelude of Storm and <img src="https://d3planner-assets.maxroll.gg/lost-ark/icons/bd_skill_01_13.png" width="20" height="20"> Soundholic to take care of the tankier Elite mobs in Phase 2 and the Boss.

- <img src="https://d3planner-assets.maxroll.gg/lost-ark/icons/bd_skill_01_12.png" width="20" height="20"> Heavenly Tune is a powerful Attack Buff you should cast whenever available.

- <img src="https://d3planner-assets.maxroll.gg/lost-ark/icons/bd_skill_01_19.png" width="20" height="20"> Save your Serenade of Courage (Z) for the Boss in phase 2.

- Use your second Awakening <img src="https://d3planner-assets.maxroll.gg/lost-ark/icons/bd_skill_01_25.png" width="20" height="20"> Oratorio once you unlock it since it does way more damage. Until then you can use <img src="https://d3planner-assets.maxroll.gg/lost-ark/icons/bd_skill_01_23.png" width="20" height="20"> Symphonia. 

 ### Gameplay
 
 Chaos Dungeon and Cube content is fairly easy to complete. A simplified rotation is used:

   1. Walk around in a circle to group up mobs.
   2. Cast Heavenly Tune.
   3. Cast Dissonance, then Stigma in front of you. The monsters will walk into the AoE, becoming slowed and staggered.
   4. If needed, cast Prelude of Storm or Sonic Vibration to keep them stunned in the AoE.
   5. For tankier mobs, you need to use Prelude of Death. This spell applies a stacking debuff on any monsters hit. After 2 seconds, if any monster with the debuff         dies, it unleashes a powerful explosion dealing insane damage to 1 nearby enemy. You can use this as a chain explosion of sorts, finishing off Elites and even   bosses.
   
**Ex: For bosses - Cast Heavenly Tune and Serenade of Courage. Gather small monsters near the boss and cast Prelude of Death. Then, cast your Awakening   (Symphonia/Oratorio). The monsters should stack on top of the boss during your cast animation and their on death explosion will proliferate to the Boss dealing massive damage.**

The Cube is slightly more difficult than Chaos Dungeon and usually requires a party and stage knowledge to complete. Check out the Cube Guide and Chaos Dungeon Guide for more information.
 
### Runes

Runes enhance skills with extra bonuses. All Rune drops are account bound and have limited availability, so placement of Runes on the correct skills is important. Below are the recommend parings. Check the *Rune Guide* for more details
