# Lost Ark Progression Guide from T1-T3 (What To Do At Level 50)

Once you reach Level 50 in Lost Ark, as a new player, things get a bit daunting, especially now that the well of content is even deeper than originally thought. So before you enter the Tier progression patch, we suggest you continue on with the main questline and gear up by tackling some daily content. To help you prepare well for the end game content after reaching 50 levels in Lost Ark, we explain the progression path from fresh 50 and gear upgrade from Tier 1 to Tier 3!

## Main Story Quest

 - Continue doing the main story quest through Shushire

The first thing to do after you hit Level 50 is  to just continue on with the main questline. You're going to reach 50 right at the End of Arthetine, or possibly early on in North Vern, and but there's still more to explore. You're going to have to do these quests eventually anyways, that's part of the prerequisites for unlocking additional tiers of content, aside from your gear score. 

After Vern, you'll need to head to the northern region of the map and reach Shushire. A quick reminder, you'll need the icebreaker ship to get through the hazards so swap that over so you don't end up wasting time. This region is such a sharp contrast from the lush high fantasy countrysides of north vern that it just feels noticeably different. 

One of the biggest misconceptions for new players is that 50 is the level-cap, it’s not, it just opens up a new chapter in your journey as a player. Reaching level 50 gives you access to the end-game but it's far from the end of the game. There are still storylines to complete, collectibles to hunt down, and a wide range of content that will continue your progression. Eventually, you’ll make it to level 60, the true level cap, but that will take months compared to the days it takes to reach level 50. 

## Awakening Abilities

  - Unlock your first awakening ability / Quest in Trixion

At the same time, you’re working through the available story content you should take some time to unlock your first class awakening ability, as well as your final normal ability. This can be done by heading to trixion and receiving a class-specific quest. Each awakening quest chain is slightly different but each rewards a unique, powerful special ability that really takes the combat experience to the next level. Each character has a second awakening ability but it’s a bit less straightforward to unlock. Once you're done with Shushire, you'll head to Rohendel on the Western Side of Arkesia, where you'll continue along with the main storyline.

Unlocking your second awakening ability sooner rather than later

Eventually, you’ll receive a purple quest from the NPC in Queen's Garden that will open up a new awakening questline. This is a rather long chain that will take you across the Entire World of Arkesia, but it's vital to gaining access to your second awakening ability. Don't forget you need to activate the ability by using the item in your bags.

For now, the end of the main questline will take you all the way through Shushire. This is important if you care about efficiency because completing that Ark will net you a full set of 302 gear. By doing this, you effectively cut down on the possibility of getting hung up right out of the gate with bad item drop RNG that could potentially hold you back the first day you reach 50.

2. T1 Daily Content & Gearing Up

With the questing done, it's time to pivot and focus on gearing up, and to start off we'll need to tackle our dailies. 


1) Chaos dungeons, Guardian Raids, Una's tasks

This breaks down into a few activities, Chaos dungeons, Guardian raids and Una’s tasks, those are the big three. The goal of doing these three things is getting upgrade materials, that's your ticket to new tiers of content. At this tier you’ll need Guardian Stones, Destruction Stones, Harmony Leapstones, and Harmony Shards. For chaos dungeons and guardian raids you can do 2 a day for maximum rewards including Lost Ark gold, but for Una's tasks, it's a bit different, you do have both daily and weekly tasks, and you’re limited to 3 of each, but the key is to make sure you’re focused on missions that award those critical upgrade materials.


2) Islands

Doing those three activities alone isn't going to get you to where you need to be in one day, so how do you continue to progress even after you’ve reached your caps? The simple answer, is islands.

Various islands around arkesia will net you the same upgrade materials that you get from chaos dungeons and guardian raids, you just need to figure out which ones. Most of these islands are always available to the player, but there are some islands that are part of that rolling calendar you unlock at level 50. This is a great time to remind you to set your Bifrost at places you plan on returning to. If you know an island has a specific Una's task objective, or rewards you with upgrade materials, save yourself the trip and set your Bifrost to cut down substantially on your travel time. 


3) Shadespire Tower

Outside of islands, there are other things you could be doing like the tower. While the benefits aren’t exactly progressing you, there are items up for grabs that will help you get ready for the challenges to come such as engraving books, permanent stat boost potions, and of course skill point potions. If you’re a casual player and this is all a bit overwhelming don't worry, take things at your own pace, or go off and do something else, again there's no real reason to push progression hard and fast, unless you're into that sort of thing. 


4) Abyssal Dungeons

You'll continue with everything we just mentioned up until the point you reach abyssal dungeons. This opens up at gear score 340, and this is the next step within the t1 progression. You don't need to do a lot of honing to get to this point. If you push past 340 it’s no big deal, you can always use the gear transfer system to move stats from one item to another. This is easy enough to do at the same tier, just go to the honing NPCs, click the transfer tab, and start moving your stats over. This does cost some silver, but it shouldn’t really hold you back from utilizing this system in any way. Once you reach 340 and have access to abyssal dungeons, stop honing. 

A small note, if you jump straight into chaos dungeons and guardian raids at level 50, and don't complete the Vern questline, you won't have access to abyssal dungeons, which is why continuing the storyline is important. 


3. T1-3 Progression Path from Fresh 50 Level

1) Tier 1 Progression Path

Requires that you reach GS 600 and complete the associated quest

Having access to demon beast canyon and necromancer's origin will give you access to your first set of heroic T1 gear, which of course you’ll need to upgrade, this time to gear score 460 to gain access to the higher tiers of T1 abyssal dungeons‘Hall of the Twisted Warlord’and‘Hildebrandt's Palace.’

Once those are unlocked you’re looking at another set of new gear, your first legendary set, still classified as T1. Here's where a bit of a material sink is required. You’ll need to keep doing your dailies and keep chipping away at islands because you'll need any and all upgrade resources required to hone your new legendary armor set. You can choose to keep your heroic set and upgrade that if you wish because once you enter Tier 2, all of the Tier 1 armor degrades anyways. Regardless the goal is to get to a gear score of 600, this is will grant you access to the next tier of content, starting with yorn chaos dungeons.


2) Tier 2 Progression Path

Start running Chaos Dungeons & Guardian Raids until GS 840

If you were able to wrap your heads around the Tier 1 progression path, here are a good news, the T2 path is very similar. Don't get too attached to your gear, because as you'll discover, we'll upgrade consistently, up until the very end. Just like before at the beginning of T2, you'll only have access to new Chaos Dungeons and Guardian Raids. Continue to run those until you reach item level 840. At this point a new set of abyssal dungeons will open up, Road of Lament and The Forge of Fallen Pride. This will allow you to craft your heroic T2 set of gear. You'll continue to upgrade that heroic set until you reach item level 960, at which point, you guessed it, you’ll have access to even more abyssal dungeons, The Sea of Indolence, Tranquil Karkosa, and Aalari's Sanctuary. Tackling these challenges will allow you to craft your legendary T2 set of gear. Again, we’re looking at a deep resource sink here, and you'll need to upgrade this legendary set to +15 if you want to reach item level 1100, which is the threshold for starting the tier 3 content. 

During this Tier 2 experience you'll start receiving gems. These are items that you can socket into your necklace, rings, and earrings, that provide your abilities with either damage increase buffs or cooldown reduction buffs.


3) Tier 3 Progression Path

Run Chaos Dungeons & Guardian Raids until GS 1325

So long as you have the gear score and have completed the required quests you now have access to tier 3 content. As Roxx, the Lost Ark community manager made clear before launch, the NA/EU tier 3 content is limited, and was implemented to introduce players to abyss raids sooner rather than later.

Smilegate has talked very openly about the success of legion raids, and how it has invigorated the playerbase, which we imagine, is largely the reason behind the quicker introduction of T3 content. If you have something special that you can offer up, you should, because undoubtably the hardcore players will want to experience it, while the casual players will just take their time and enjoy the ride, which they absolutely should. Now according to the most recent Lost Ark blog post, the T3 content that will be available at launch includes T3 Chaos Dungeons up to stage 3, the Velganos Guardian raid, and Oreha's Well, a set of two Abyssal Dungeons. Depending on when you read this guide, this may change.

Just like with the other tiers, you’ll start off by doing the new chaos dungeons and guardian raids. You’ll continue that daily grind for resources, hone the set of rare t3 armor you get from those chaos dungeons until you reach 1325, and the first abyssal dungeon, becomes available, Aira’s Oculus. From this abyssal dungeon you’ll receive your heroic tier 3 set which you’ll upgrade to 1340, at which point you’ll have access to the next Abyssal Dungeon, Oreha Preveza. At this point the train kind of comes off the tracks since the rest of the tier 3 rollout is a bit of a mystery, but the goal is to reach a gear score of 1370, so that you’re ready for the next big chunk of content argos, and the introduction of abyssal raids.
