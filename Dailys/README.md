# Daily Check List

- [ ] Daily and Weekly Requests
  
The first thing to do is set up your daily and weekly tasks. You can open up Una’s or Epona’s Requests tab by pressing ALT+J. Accept the tasks that reward the materials you currently need. For example, Citrine Shards and Harmony Shards are in high demand, so you’ll probably want to focus on those quests. Remember to do this both for Daily and Weekly tasks.

- [ ] Daily Events

On the top left of your screen, you should see an alarm clock icon that tracks all of the upcoming daily events. You can click on that and plan your upcoming island events, chaos rifts, field bosses, and other things. Completing this is an easy way to get free materials and other items.
